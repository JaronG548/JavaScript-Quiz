# JavaScript-Quiz

## Description

The purpose of this challenge was to create a webpage that had a timed quiz about JavaScript and if you got one incorrect it would subtract from your time left. This was difficult because it involved building everything from scratch. The most difficult part for me was the JavaScript itself since it involves a lot more code compared to HTML and CSS because of the Logic and Functions needed to have the webpage function properly. As of 11/28/23 the project is still under development since I am still working on the JavaScript part of this project. I learned more about HTML semantic elements, QuereySelectors and getElements. I need to work more on my JavaScript functions, If statements and logic and Math.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

As of 11/28/23 the webpage is barely functionable. You will be able to click the start button and a placeholder for the test will appear on your screen. The idea of the complete webpage is that once you click Start you will get a test with a set amount of questions with a Timer in the top right counting down in 60 seconds. Everytime you would get a question wrong it would go down by 5 seconds and the test will finish either when you complete it or time runs out. Then you can input your initials with your score and log it on the Highscore screen.
